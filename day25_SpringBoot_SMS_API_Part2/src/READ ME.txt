copy all from day25_SpringBoot_SMS_API :

=> the only addition will be on the repositories and the corresponding service and API

repository :

StudentRepository
    //Search Students By First Name And Last Name
    Student findByFirstNameAndLastName(String firstName, String lastName);
    //- Search Teachers by Student Name (contains)
    Student findByFirstNameContaining(String firstName);

TeacherRepository
    //- Search Students by Teacher's Last Name
    Teacher findAllTeacherByLastName(String lastName);

controller API : notice that we used mostly @RequestParam for searching
    => ?field_name=field_value_to_be_searched : changes on URL
